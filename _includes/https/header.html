    <h1>Secure HTTP (HTTPS)</h1>
    <p>
       This data measures whether federal domains support the HTTPS protocol (<code>https://</code>), and the strength of that support. HTTPS provides a secure connection across the internet between websites and their visitors, and is becoming the new baseline for public web services. As part of this shift, the U.S. federal government is in the process of transitioning <a href="https://https.cio.gov">entirely to HTTPS</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that HTTPS generally <strong>does not affect</strong> whether a website is vulnerable to hacking. For more information on what HTTPS does (and doesn't do), <a href="https://https.cio.gov/faq/">visit the HTTPS FAQ</a>.
