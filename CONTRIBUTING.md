# Contributor Guidelines

Want to contribute? Here are a few guidelines to following:

1. Create a branch that lightly defines what you are working on (e.g. adding-styles).
2. Once you are ready to submit a pull request, push your branch up to the repo.
3. Submit your pull request against `master` branch.
