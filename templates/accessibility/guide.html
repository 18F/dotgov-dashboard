      <h3>Accessibility Standards</h3>

      <article>
        <h4>Section 508</h4>
        <p>
        In 2000, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was amended to include technical requirements that required all Federal government Electronic & Information Technology (EIT) be made accessible to persons with disabilities. ‘Section 508’ has since become synonymous with accessibility standards in government jargon. Section 508 is a sweeping law mandating accessibility for everything from computer hardware to mobile phones to government websites.
        </p>
        <p>
        While Section 508 laid out rules and definitions for how information technology could be made accessible, it did not lay out strict, testable standards for websites. The state of the web has changed dramatically in the intervening 16 years, and will continue to evolve over time. As a result, it is impossible to fully automate the measurement of Section 508 conformance, and only a professional evaluator can certify if a technology conforms with Section 508 requirements. As such, the error reports generated on Pulse DO NOT constitute a full evaluation of 508 conformance; rather, the error reports are meant to help web developers and content managers correct and avoid common accessibility errors that could contribute to making a site inaccessible.

        <h4>WCAG 2.0</h4>
        <p>
        Around the same time that the government was amending Section 508, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was busy developing their own standards. The first official version, released in 1999, was call the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0). To keep pace with the evolving online environment, the standards were updated in 2008 to their current version, WCAG 2.0.  In the proposed Section 508 Standards refresh, the web content section formally incorporates the more detailed WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards. This chart illustrates the <a href='http://www.access-board.gov/wcag2-508'>differences between Existing 508 and WCAG 2.0 Standards</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        WCAG 2.0 consists of 12 broad standards organized under four overarching accessibility principles. Each of the 12 broad standards are further subdivided into more specific standards. The four guiding principles are that websites should be:
        <ul>
          <li>Perceivable</li>
          <li>Operable</li>
          <li>Understandable</li>
          <li>Robust</li>
        </ul>
        We will not review all of the WCAG standards here, but you can read more about the WCAG 2.0 guidelines on the W3C’s WCAG 2.0 site.
        </p>
        <p>
        <u>Why is this important?</u>
        </p>
        <p>
        Citizens rely on their government for a range of essential services that impact their well-being, such as medicare/medicaid/social security support, assistance in finding low-income housing, travel information from the State Department, health information from the CDC, etc. Disabled veterans rely on the support of the Department of Veteran’s Affairs for a range of vital services. All citizens must file an annual tax return. Many small companies access government websites to bid on government contracts and grow their business.
        </p>
        <p>
        When this information is presented in a way that is not accessible to people with disabilities, those people are shut out from essential services and opportunities that should be available to all Americans. Additionally, a large number of Americans with disabilities are employed by the federal government, and having accessible technology is essential for them to be able to perform their work effectively. Accessibility has long been a priority for the federal government, and a recent White House web standards memo further reinforced our commitment that all federal websites comply with accessibility regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
        <u>Limitations</u>
        </p>
        <p>
        Automatically measuring full compliance with 508 standards or WCAG 2.0 guidelines is not possible with the current state of technology. For instance, while we can automatically check if an image on a website has an alt text attribute, we cannot measure if that alt text is sufficiently descriptive; a picture of a dog with an alt text attribute that reads “cow” would pass the automatic check, but since the alt text is incorrect, the image is not accessible. While we can detect the background color and text color by reading a page’s CSS, we may not be able to detect the color of an image; if text is overlayed on a background image, we would not be able to measure if the level of contrast is sufficient. We can measure if closed captions or transcripts are available for audio content, but we cannot automatically verify the accuracy or comprehensiveness of the text content. It is for these reasons that fully assessing a site’s accessibility still requires evaluation by an accessibility professional.
        </p>
        <p>
        <u>How common accessibility errors impact website visitors</u>
        </p>
        <p>
        The WCAG 2.0 standards define a wide range of requirements for accessible web content. Here are a few examples of common accessibility errors:
        <ul>
          <li>A website uses an image to convey information without including a descriptive alt text attribute. This error would make it impossible for the visually impaired to access the information conveyed by the image.</li>
          <li>The text on a page has poor contrast with the background color (for instance, light green text on a dark green background). This makes it difficult or impossible for those with some visual impairments (such as colorblindness) to use the information.</li>
          <li>Information is conveyed to the user through a video or audio file without captions or a transcript of the content. Those with auditory impairments would not be able to access the information.</li>
          <li>A site contains animation with flashing colors or lights that could induce seizures in those with medical conditions like epilepsy.</li>
          <li>A site requires the reader to use a visually-based element, such as animation, to navigate a site, without an alternate navigation option. This would make it impossible for people using some assistive technologies like screen readers to navigate the site.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
        <u>How we measure</u>
        </p>
        <p>
        While we cannot fully measure accessibility with automated tools, we can measure for broader errors on websites, such as whether an image does or does not contain alt text, whether there is sufficient contrast between the text and background, whether a page is properly structured for someone using a screen reader to access the information, etc. To do this, we employ an open-source tool known as pA11y. pA11y uses another open-source tool, the HTML_Codesniffer, to identify errors which violate the principles and standards defined in WCAG 2.0.
        </p>
        <p>
        <u>Other measurement tools</u>
        </p>
        <p>
        While pA11y is the tool we chose to measure accessibility on Pulse, there are a range of other excellent proprietary and open-source tools available to assist web developers and IT managers in understanding how to build accessible technology.
        </p>
        <p>
        The HTML_Codesniffer, the technology behind pA11y, is a browser extension that can be used to automatically detect some accessibility errors on a webpage. The HTML_Codesniffer will point out the particular code snippet with the error, the location of the error on the page, and the principle violated by the error.
        </p>
        <p>
        The University of Illinois has been working for several years to develop another free, open-source tool, the <a href='http://fae20.cita.illinois.edu/'>Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE)</a>. While the tool is still under development, the current version is an excellent way to evaluate a full website; in contrast to pA11y, the FAE can crawl the subdomains of a website, allowing a more comprehensive scan that can identify more potential accessibility issues.
        </p>
        <p>
        <u>How to correct accessibility errors</u>
        </p>
        <p>
        The majority of the accessibility errors detected by Pulse are fairly straightforward to correct. The tools listed above provide web developers and content managers with the information they need to pinpoint the errors on their pages. While some errors may involve a significant overhaul of a site’s architecture, most can be corrected by deleting errant tags, making minor CSS adjustments, and adding alt text to images. If you need help fixing errors identified in Pulse, contact your agency’s 508 coordinator.
        </p>
        <p>
        Additionally, GSA’s Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP) conducts training to help 508 coordinators and IT/content professionals better understand how to build accessible technology.
