## Draft 

The .gov dashboard will be developed in several iterations, each with a focus on delivering at least one new usable functionality. Each iteration will focus on one or two areas of .gov policy, as described in the .gov policy memos. 

The first iterations will be focused on the "low-hanging fruit" of .gov policy, which is to say, the areas of .gov policy for which quantification structures already exist or could be developed with minimal time or effort. For the first iteration, there will be two pages: HTTPS and web analytics (DAP or otherwise).
