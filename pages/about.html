  	Pulse is a project of the General Services Administration that measures how U.S. government domains are following best practices for federal websites.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Pulse is also an <strong>experiment</strong> built on automated tools, and is <strong>probably not perfect</strong>. Everything on Pulse is measured over the public internet, and can be reviewed by anyone.

				<h3>
					What does Pulse measure about federal domains?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The first two best practices Pulse is measuring are the use of <a href="/https/">HTTPS</a>, and participation in the federal government's <a href="/analytics/">Digital Analytics Program</a>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="what-domains-are-being-measured">
				<h3>
					What federal domains are being measured?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Currently, Pulse uses the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/data/tree/gh-pages/dotgov-domains">official <code>.gov</code> domain list</a> as a starting point, and focuses on domains owned by federal agencies. This also includes a few domains ending in <code>.fed.us</code>. Domains ending in other suffixes, such as <code>.mil</code> or <code>.us</code>, are not included at this time.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="why-https">
				<h3>
					Why does Pulse measure HTTPS?
				</h3>
				<p>
					HTTPS provides a secure connection across the internet, and is becoming the new baseline for public web services across the internet. As part of this shift, the U.S. federal government is in the process of transitioning <a href="https://https.cio.gov">entirely to HTTPS</a>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="why-dap">
				<h3>
					Why does Pulse measure participation in the Digital Analytics Program?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> is an important federal government project that gives federal agencies and the public a window into how people use government services. Participation in the program benefits everyone, and is open to all federal agencies.

			<li id="send-feedback">
				<h3>
					Where can I send feedback?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The best place to leave feedback or ask questions is <a href="https://github.com/18F/pulse/issues">on GitHub</a>.  You can also email <a href="mailto:pulse@cio.gov">pulse@cio.gov</a>
