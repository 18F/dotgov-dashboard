    <h1>What domains are measured?</h1>

    <p>
      Pulse measures DAP participation for <strong>publicly accessible <code>.gov</code> domains</strong> in the federal government's <strong>executive branch</strong>. Domains which do nothing but redirect to other websites <strong>are not measured</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This currently amounts to around 800 domains.
    </p>

    <h1>How to participate</h1>

    <p>
      Any publicly accessible federal website in the executive branch can participate in the <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> (DAP). The easiest way to get started is to <a href="mailto:dap@gsa.gov">send the DAP team an email</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once an agency has established a relationship with the DAP, the agency will be asked to incorporate the DAP's <a href="https://github.com/digital-analytics-program/gov-wide-code">government-wide JavaScript code</a> into their website(s). For detailed implementation guidance, data and privacy details, and other information, review the <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/common-questions-about-dap-faq/">Digital Analytics Program FAQ</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Fields</h1>

    <h3>Participates in DAP?</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Values:</strong> No, <strong>Yes</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Measurement is performed by comparing the set of evaluated <code>.gov</code> domains to the <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/data/sites.csv">list of participating federal domains and subdomains</a> published by the DAP. This list is created by looking at reported web traffic in the DAP's underlying database.
